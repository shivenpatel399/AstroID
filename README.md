# Astro ID Bot

This is a bot created to identify different stars for the Science Olympiad Event, Astronomy.
It consists of picture identification of different stars where when you run an image command, it outputs an image and you have to guess what star it is.

## Manual
To ask for an image, type a.i 

To answer, type a.a [insert answer here]. Make sure to add dashes between spaces 

To skip, type a.s

To get a new image of the insect, use a.p 

To ask for a hint, use a.h and specify if you want the number of letters, the first letter, or the last letter

To ask for the list available in the bot, use a.l
